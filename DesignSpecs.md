# Design Specs:

## **Temporary** Plan for Design, suggested by Rohan
- Use Arduino to sample and send data of transcribed chessboard to raspberry pi
- raspberry pi then sends information to backend server which manages live games
- backend server saves game and game statistics to database
- frontend calls from backend to do whatever user wants
